                <p style="color: white;">
                  Educational attainment in the Latinx community is a stark issue. For many years, the Latinx community have suffered from a lack of educational attainment. This lack of educational attainment was caused by many factors which include socioeconomic status, hegemony and other structural factors which limit the agency of the Latinx community. In this blog, the media’s implication of the Latinx community and current disparities in Latinx educational trends will be analyzed and a call to action with various methods is suggested to find a solution to this discongruence in the Latinx community.

                    <h3 class="h2">Ethnic isolation</h3>
                    <p>Terrible learning environments not only hinder the experiences of the Latinx community but deteriorate the ability to brainstorm and understand. Segregation within a culture creates both physical and mental disparities. It also leads to alienation. According to the media article by Strauss, the  segregation problem between Latinx and other peers has become way more complex since the 1970s, less black and white due to more isolation of Latino children (Strauss, 2019). The media suggests segregation of Latin school children. Not only does this discourage civic unity but implicitly indicates the status quo. Moving on, the media article also suggests that in 1998, the average Latino child attended an elementary school in which four of every 10 schoolmates were white. By 2015, that number had fallen to three white peers for every 10 students enrolled, indicating a fall in diversity (Strauss, 2019). When a community has less diversity, it may not increase its cultural awareness which is significant in educational attainment.
Unsupportive learning environments for students in Latinx communities have grown increasingly common as modern forms of oppression have progressed. One form of oppression that is subtle yet extremely detrimental to the Latinx experience is segregation in schools through redlining and elitist practices. Segregation within a culture creates both physical and mental disparities as well as alienation. According to the Washington Post article by Strauss, the segregation issue for Latinx students has become much more complex since the 1970s due to a decrease in the likelihood that Latinx children would attend schools with white peers (Strauss, 2019).  Strauss mentions that in 1998, the average Latinx child attended an elementary school in which four of every 10 schoolmates were white. By 2015, that number had fallen to three white peers for every 10 students enrolled, indicating a fall in diversity (Strauss, 2019). Not only does the increased segregation discourage civic unity, but it also implicitly indicates the status quo of keeping white populations separate and superior. When a community is less diverse, there is a considerable risk of less cultured and therefore more closed-minded citizens. With minimal awareness of what other cultures have to offer or value, there is little sense of duty to want to understand others, making it easy to form a superiority complex, which is unfortunately what has played out in the United States’ education system.

                    <p>For Hispanics in the United States, education is at an apparent disadvantage. Many begin school without proper economic and resources which can clearly be seen by the apparent socioeconomic status in the Latinx community. Furthermore, schools are unable to compensate for these disparities. For Hispanics in the United States, the lack of educational attainment is caused by their parents lack of knowledge about the US educational system. Furthermore, structural factors such as a lack of resources, segregation and bias continue to hinder educational success of the Latinx community. These structural factors tend to culminate causing Hispanics to have low rates of high school and college degree attainment.  Latinos are more likely to attend community college (42 percent) compared to whites (24 percent) (Fry 2002). There are some costs associated with enrolling in community college instead of a four-year college, such as taking longer to graduate from a four-year college or not transferring to a four-year institution (Ornelas 2002).

                    <h3 class="h2">Hegemony</h3>
                    <p>Hegemony refers to the dominance of one social group over another. Hegemony plays a part in the system that is harming students. The power is currently in the hands of Superintendent Austin Beutney, a “multimillionaire with experience in corporate downsizing but none in education” who argues that the district’s reserve of $2 billion “is already accounted for in future spending and that cuts should be made” (Caputo-Pearl). The aspects of this story involving a rich, white man in power withholding funds that should go to needy students of disenfranchised groups are all too familiar in the history of hegemony in America. On
a more national scale, the same pattern of white people in power compromising the needs of
at-risk Latinx students is seen. In the case of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, she has
publicly stated that in terms of whether schools should report undocumented students to
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, it is a “school decision and a local community decision”
(Silva). Education is not a decision but a fundamental right. Clearly, authority and dominance clearly limit the agency of many Latinx school children.

            <span style="color:white;">Call to Action
When Latinx children are growing up, they need to be an environment which prepares them for a better future. This environment should consider the learning ability of the child. One of the most important factors in school success is active parent participation in their children's education prior to their entry into preschool or kindergarten programs. Specific activities, such as reading have been shown to enhance comprehending ability and language acquisition (Schneider et al., 2016). One of the main reasons why Latinx schoolchildren are subject to poor learning environments is because of a lack of active participation. As mentioned earlier, schools exercise their social dominance because Latinx school children may be unprepared for anything related to reading. Active participation may increase diversity and cultural awareness too, both of which are significant in educational attainment. In addition to active participation, preschool attendance is a crucial factor. Furthermore, quality preschool and kindergarten experiences provide the basic foundation for children's overall development. Specifically, for Hispanic children,</span>

<span style="color:black;">preschool can serve as a better learning environment than home (Schneider et al, 2006). Different environments do indeed have different effects. By focusing on school, Latinx school children are able to focus and not get distracted. This may increase teacher student relationships in the long run. Furthermore, the last factor is the educational background of everyone in the family. Limited success in early schooling can be traced to several family background characteristics. Specific factors, such as having a mother who did not complete high school or having parents who speak a language other than English in the home place children at risk of not succeeding academically (Schneider et al.). For this reason, parents must take an initiative to speak English at home and maintain an academic friendly environment. Moreover, this may increase knowledge of educational systems in the US and prevent ethnic isolation.</span>

                  Many in the Latinx community are subject to oppression, hegemony through dominance of American culture on Latinx, structural and economic factors. Their adversaries have significantly affected educational attainment within the Latinx community. While many are going to high school and college, ethnic isolation and other factors have significantly disrupted this experience. Bridging the gap in educational attainment can be done by increasing diversity, cultural awareness and knowledge of our education systems. Educational attainment is a significant part of our lives. It can significantly improve the experience of Latinx school children if we as a community strive to make it a better place. It is important to remain cognizant of the need to humanize Latinos as not exclusively possessing subordinate job positions or not being educated or driven enough to reach the same achievements as other racial groups. The way the system is structured to not lend support to bilingual students, students from low-income families, and students in segregated schools has allowed complacency to thrive. This complacency, if not resolved, can easily transform into bigotry and outright discrimination, which all tie into hegemony and the success of rich, white officials in silencing voices of people of color. Latinos desperately need attention from legislators and a new cultural awareness that is able to empathize with their ongoing struggle of not only overcoming racism, but systemic abuse on account of their background, immigration status, or socioeconomic status. Thus, education for the Latinx community must be prioritized.
